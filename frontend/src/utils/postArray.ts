A sorta fish out of water story about something or someone being accepted by those that are seen as dangerous or outcasts from society but aren really. If you like that sorta idea what would be your idea for a similar movie or show to Chappie? Let’s discuss about it.",

It’s hard as a history buff for sure because this film is way off as far as accuracy goes and the fact that Mel Gibson isn’t the greatest person (to put it mildly) but the man has a talent for cinema. Despite me being incredibly far removed from any relation to ancient tribal people, the characters in this story are super relatable. Their sense of humor, the family bonds, the fear… this film really makes you think that you could have been anyone of them. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend you do. It’s an incredible thriller and criminally underrated.",

Director Quentin Tarantino said, I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year. Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it a vision, adding, Many pictures today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of whats known as civilization. I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking. Actor Edward James Olmos said, I was totally caught off guard. Its arguably the best movie Ive seen in years. I was blown away. In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films."

After a long day on the ranch, I pour myself a tall glass of milk, huff some paint, and log on to the Dell I got for Christmas in 2006 with Windows XP to play some League of Legends. The client needs to patch. That's fine. I reheat a bowl of beans and lard for supper, and it's already at 13% by the time I get back, well ahead of schedule. I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job. I queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go. The first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.",

I cant remeber a champion with this high of a banrate since Kassadins +90% banrate back in the day. Also since Hecarims performance is actually quite bad, even with the absurd banrate. Do you think it will be lower the longer the patch goes and people figure out, that his performance is quite bad or is it just because the WR is misleading? It is very interesting though.",

The only thing I could see happening if it were implemented in some way would be players wishing on the weapon banner instead of event characters as unless they want the new character, they might be more inclined to get the starglitter from weapons than from losing to a character.

Maybe customers think, I dont want to pay that much for a 2pack but I dont want to buy the option with lower discounts either. Maybe they feel like they would make a bad deal either way.

I really hope it's helpful for you all and appreciate any feedback you might have.

This method of thinking takes time to develop but once it did I really started to encounter less errors and a smoother workflow. Limited knowledge of the language can take you a long way if you know how to google and the proper way to think it through. I’m starting to realize I’m capable of more than I think in this regard.",

There are obviously a lot of forces at work here, the shuttle is moving at a pretty good clip by the time this happens. The actual separation is (or at least was I may be a little out of date here) initiated by explosive bolts that push the boosters away from the main body of the shuttle after the vector thrusts are zero'ed out to make sure they peel away as they do. Obviously it would be really bad if the booster impacted the shuttle at this point. I don't know if you're talking about the NSD/explosive bolts firing, or the way the leading edge of what is basically a visible pressure wave at the front of the craft diverges into three separate as the cones split apart."

I took three sips from my glass of wine and then set it down - forgotten. I went in blind. I thought, I‘d have a relaxing sunday evening after a hell of a week… oh boy did I not know what I was getting myself into. About halfway in, I began to understand glimpses of the bigger picture and even though I was intrigued from the very first sentence on, now my curiosity was burning. I HAD TO KNOW what was going on. What and where is the house? Who is the narrator? Every page that half satisfied my hunger for more also left me wanting, and so I read on. And on and on and on until I was done. My husband has gone to sleep two hours ago, and I didn’t manage more than a „yes me too“ when he went to bed and told me he loved me, not even looking up from the pages. Sorry, love, for the gross neglectance. And sorry my beautiful pinot noir that I was so looking forward to and then simply forgot. You both deserved better. But I needed to know. I had to continue. There was no stopping this train. I thank you all for asking me to read this book. And if you haven‘t: I kept it spoiler-free on purpose, because please read this astonishing work of art!",

There are about three things about the book that interest me: First, what I find so odd about this one is that apparently he thought it was his magnum opus, even though he’d written The Grapes of Wrath 13 years earlier, to widespread acclaim. I don’t think this one rises to that standard, but what could? Second, the way the book talks about the sex industry— it figures prominently, and I guess I’m just surprised that it was published at all by such a famous author, since a large portion of the U.S. must have looked at it as simply a dirty book. I guess when you’re John Steinbeck you can publish whatever you want. The last surprise for me was that this book contains the first fictional representation I know about of a “sociopath“— the book never uses that term— somebody utterly incapable of empathizing with other people."

I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out. Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?” These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy.",

While we still plan to do that, we think it’s important to acknowledge that this year, things feel quite a bit different. The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and stress; and throughout this time, it’s become even more clear how valuable Reddit is to millions of people looking for community, a place to seek and share information, provide support to one another, or simply to escape the reality of our collective ‘new normal.’",

As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them. We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta. We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.",

If this is the first post of this series you've seen, I am baking along with the newest season of The Great British Baking Show this year and, after so much love on last week's post, sharing my progress each week! *I apologize for only photographing 12 macarons when the challenge called for 18. I actually made 24, but it was really early when I took pictures and I didn't want to get it all out and redo it once I'd realized my mistake 😅 These macarons-that-don't-look-like-typical-macarons are in honor of the Signature challenge this week, and I flavored them with a Thai tea buttercream! And I'll probably just be looking at them all day because I love them 🥲 Thank you all for being so supportive and inspiring!"

Absolutely sucks, but I am just going to bite the bullet because I don't want to wind up in tax court 3 years from now. But the problem is - how in the fuck am i actually even supposed to do this? I literally have to track down every trade / swap / yield farm I was in via metamask and track down the historical spot prices for every transaction to accurately report the gains and losses at the time of the trades.. I literally use like 6 different exchanges and many more defi protocols. Has anyone successfully used any of the crypto tax software out there? CoinLedger, CoinTracking, TokenTax etc? Or should I just pay my accountant thousands to figure it out for me?",

The seized assets of the man include his Lamborghini, two McLarens, and two BMWs, according to reports. He was renting a lakefront mansion in Burlington, Ontario that he spent $45,000 a month for, and previously paid for promotional articles about himself on websites like Forbes."
